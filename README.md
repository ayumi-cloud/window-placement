# Window Placement on the web

This repository considers web platform functionality for multi-screen devices.
The goals here are to elucidate some uses, limitations, and proposals for web
technology on multi-screen devices. Window Placement concerns the creation and
movement of windows throughout the set of displays that comprise the overall
visual workspace of a device.

Please see the
[Explainer](https://github.com/spark008/window-placement/blob/master/EXPLAINER.md)
and [W3C Security and Privacy Self-Review Questionnaire response](https://github.com/spark008/window-placement/blob/master/security_and_privacy.md)
documents for a deeper dive into this topic. File issues here, reply to our
[W3C WICG Discourse posting](https://discourse.wicg.io/latest), or
reach out as you see fit with feedback, relevant use cases, and thoughts.

Please also take a look at the related
[Screen Enumeration API proposal](https://github.com/spark008/screen-enumeration),
which considers a similar set of topics regarding the information available
about the screens connected to a given device.
